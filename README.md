Hockey Manager - a hockey team management simulation

The Hockey Manager is meant to be a game for hockey fans.  As a user of The Hockey Manager you will be able to log in and manage your hockey team.  You will draft your players, hire a staff to train them, hire scouts and send them to watch other teams.  You will then be able to set up your lines for game day and see how your team does.

This is a personal development project as I learn to code in Python.
